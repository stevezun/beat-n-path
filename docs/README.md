### Title

Beat n Path

## Description

The purpose of the app is to create a tailored playlist for people who are exercising. The purpose of the app is to match the Heart bpm to the bpm of a specific style of music or curated playlist.

I want to attempt the program where you begin by inserting a number value that will be for the desired heart rate(BPM) and program will pull up a set of songs within a range that is directly the same BPM as the entered BPM in the Spotify playlist/library

An additional feature that I want to create is that you create zones or categories of desired heart rate with a set timer. The program will pull up music within the desired heart rate for that set amount of time. You would be able to create multiple zones that would run concurrently with each other to simulate warm-up, intensity, and cooldown, or any other custom arrangement the user wants to create.

## Intended users

The primary audience of the playlist will be for people who exercise and whose Heart bpm is important for performance and enjoy having music to match their exertion levels.

The preset zones can be key for personal trainers, fitness instructors, and coaches who curate their exercise routine and would like music to accompany their plan without them having to worry about adjusting during activity.

The feature of being able to pull out music based their characteristics can be used by DJs and music producers where those details can be an important component into creating something that they are attempting to create.



## External services/data
The external service/data will require a connection to Spotify music app and library, eventually the service can be connected to other music libraries.
